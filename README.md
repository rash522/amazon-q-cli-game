# 🎮 Amazon Q Developer CLI: Platformer Game MVP

This project demonstrates the power of **Amazon Q Developer CLI** by building a simple yet functional **2D platformer game** using **Python** and **Pygame** — all from a single prompt!

Even without any prior game development experience, this game was generated as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** using Amazon Q Developer by describing what features we wanted. It’s a great way to get started with AI-powered software development.

## 🚀 Prompt Used to Build the Game

> *“Create a clean, well-structured 2D platformer game using Python and Pygame. Include a player with gravity, jumping, and platform collision. Add coins for score, enemies that reduce lives, and show score/lives on screen. Use colorful graphics with simple sprites, smooth movement, and a full gameplay loop (start, game over, restart). Keep the visuals appealing and gameplay smooth.”*
