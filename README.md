# üéÆ Amazon Q Developer CLI: Platformer Game

This project demonstrates the power of **Amazon Q Developer CLI** by building a simple yet functional **2D platformer game** using **Python** and **Pygame** ‚Äî all from a single prompt!

Even without any prior game development experience, this game was generated as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** using Amazon Q Developer by describing what features we wanted. It‚Äôs a great way to get started with AI-powered software development.
